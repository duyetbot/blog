# Hero Component Added

Added modern Hero component to website:

## Features:
- Animated typewriter effect for title
- 3D code window with hover effects
- Stats grid with animated progress bars
- Trust badges (SOC 2, GDPR)
- Company logos section
- Responsive design (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- Gradient backgrounds with subtle glow effects

## Location
- Component: `/root/.openclaw/workspace/duet-company/duet-company.github.io/components/Hero.tsx`
- Repo: duet-company.github.io (markdown site, not this Next.js app)

Note: This was created in the wrong location - needs to be moved to ~/projects/website if you want to use it in the Next.js app.
